## Delete Chat History
- Added a Delete feature which deletes all the messages in a particular chat channel

- Request URL
(/chat/history/{admin}/{user_id}/{chat_channel})

- This takes the admin name, user_id and chat_channel id and performs a DELETE Operation on all the messages of that chat_channel in the database.

- Example Response
```
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Chat history cleared for naman:abc:abc",
  "data": {
    "admin": "naman",
    "user_id": "abc",
    "chat_channel": "abc_123",
    "messages_deleted": 0,
    "cleared_at": "2025-09-05T15:00:16.784292"
